# Welcome to TekkenDocs!

The app is deployed at [tekkendocs.com](https://tekkendocs.com). Tekken docs gathers frame data and learning resources for the video game Tekken.

## Development

The application is built with Remix, so follows their development standards. First run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Start the Remix development asset server and the Express server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Running with mock data

To run the application with a live connection, you need to set appropriate keys in the environment.
To make the app run without these keys, and without live data, you can run against mock data.

```sh
npm run dev-mock-data
```
